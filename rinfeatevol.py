def makeRINcompBasisMat(seqlist: list()) -> np.array:
    '''
    Takes in a list of presumably identical protein structure types, and constructs a base matrix to enable the sequential comparison of this set of structures. This matrix is of size (natoms x natoms) where the number of atoms is equal to the number in the trimmed, representative length of each protein in the set. Then the sequences are aligned and numbers assigned to the starting sequence number. Thus, a single basis matrix will be populated with RIN information for each identical version in a future function.
    
    Output from this function is constructed by necessarily assuming that the proteins:
    - Have a similar sequence identity.
    - Have a similar length.
    - May have some irregularities especially towards the ends of the sequence. Then the ends may be trimmed a slight amount to enable comparison of the interior residues of the full set of proteins.
    
    Construct the basis matrix for the RIN's:
    - Must be the size of (len(natoms) x len(natoms)) to account for all possible internal interactions!
    - Number each residue, instead of giving residue names (these might change!)
    - Be sure to construct the basis sequence carefully using the above functions!!!
    - Potentially necessary: slice off first ~20 and last ~20 residues to normalize length of the protein before calculating RIN adjacency matrix for some network type. Might make this a parameter of the input function that slices off p % of the front and end of each structure.
